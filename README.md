## üñºÔ∏è Semiconductor Diagrams  

**DSSC Energy Band**  
<img src="DSSC-Energy-Band.png" alt="DSSC Energy Band" width="600"> 

*Illustrates electron‚Äìhole separation and charge transport in dye-sensitized solar cells. Designed to support instruction in renewable energy and semiconductor physics.*  



**Perovskite Structure**  
<img src="Perovskite.png" alt="Perovskite" width="600"> 

*Highlights the layered structure of perovskite solar cells. Useful for understanding material interfaces and photovoltaic design.*  

**Lift-off vs. Etching**  
![Lift-off vs. Etching](Lift-off-&-etching.png)  
*Side-by-side comparison of two photolithography-based patterning techniques. The lift-off process demonstrates how a deposited metal layer is patterned by dissolving photoresist, while the etching process shows selective material removal after UV exposure and development. Useful for teaching semiconductor device fabrication methods.*  

**Etching Process**  
![Etching Process](Etching-profiles.png)  
*Shows the stages of material removal using wet and dry etching. Explains how etching defines micro- and nano-scale features in semiconductor devices.*  

**Cell Assembly**  
![Cell Assembly](Cell-assembly.png)  
*Step-by-step illustration of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) assembly. Shows the deposition of TiO‚ÇÇ and Pt electrodes, dye sensitization, sealing, and electrolyte filling to complete the device structure.*
